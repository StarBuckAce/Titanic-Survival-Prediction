# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The Titanic dataset is widely used in the data science community as a beginner-friendly project to practice data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification techniques. The dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
